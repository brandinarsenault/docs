# Introduction

Welcome the UserSpice Documentation! Below, you will see information broken down into several categories, including classes, functions, and features.

On the left, you will be able to navigation specific categories and their topics, including search, and on the right you will see both PHP and SQL code snippets.

Here are a few notes regarding the formatting of the documentation:

1. Parameters are ordered in the format they can be supplied
1. If you wish to skip a parameter, you should supply the default value
1. If the Default Value column is empty - it is required
1. Functions are contained in Helper files in `users/helpers` - the corresponding helper file is included at the bottom of the function in the docs
1. Functions are case sensitive in PHP
1. If the version a function was added in is not included, assume it was added in UserSpice 5.1.6 (this is when the documentation was written)

If you have any recommendations or requests for the documents, we encourage you to make a pull request on GitHub.

Thank you.
